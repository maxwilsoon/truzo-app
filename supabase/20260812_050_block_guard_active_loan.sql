-- M050: Block guard — prevent blocking while an active funded loan exists
--
-- Problem: A borrower could block their lender before repaying, making repayment
--          socially impossible and breaking the trust model.
--
-- Fix: block_user raises 'active_loan_outstanding' if a funded (unrepaid) money_request
--      exists between the two users in either direction. The block is rejected; the user
--      must repay (or receive repayment) before blocking is allowed.
--
-- Scope: block_user only. report_user is unaffected — reporting is independent of
--        financial relationships.
